          Hello! Welcome to my page. I'm Joseph Ibeh, a dedicated Cloud/DevOps
          Engineering student and the President of the School of Engineering at
          AltSchool Africa. My journey into technology is powered by a solid
          foundation in scientific inquiry and analytical thinking, developed
          through my Bachelor's and ongoing Master's degrees in Biology.
        </p>
        <p>
          Currently, I'm deeply immersed in Cloud/DevOps Engineering at
          AltSchool Africa, aiming to leverage my diverse background to excel in
          this dynamic field. As President, I am committed to fostering a
          supportive environment, promoting academic excellence, and enhancing
          the student experience.
        </p>
