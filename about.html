        <p><strong>Hello! Welcome to my page.</strong></p>
        <p>
          I'm Joseph Ibeh, a passionate Cloud & DevOps Engineering student
          committed to leveraging technology to solve complex challenges. I’m
          currently advancing my skills through the Cloud Engineering program at
          AltSchool Africa School of Engineering, while pursuing my Master’s
          degree at Nnamdi Azikiwe University.
        </p>

        <p>
          Alongside my technical journey, I serve as President of the School of
          Engineering at AltSchool Africa, where I foster a collaborative and
          supportive environment for students. Additionally, as a Campus
          Ambassador for AltSchool Africa at Nnamdi Azikiwe University, I engage
          with the student community to promote tech education and innovation.
        </p>

        <p>
          My journey into technology stems from a strong foundation in
          scientific inquiry and analytical thinking, developed during my
          academic background in Biology. This perspective influences my
          problem-solving approach in Cloud & DevOps Engineering, particularly
          in designing scalable systems and optimizing processes.
        </p>

        <p>
          Beyond technical projects, I have a passion for technical writing,
          creating clear and concise content to demystify Cloud & DevOps
          concepts for a broad and diverse audience, on platforms like Dev.to,
          among others.
        </p>

        <p>
          Let's connect and explore opportunities to collaborate, innovate, and
          drive meaningful change in tech together!
